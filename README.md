# Sched-ext Scheduler Contest KIT'25

![Scheduler Contest Logo](./img/sched_contest.png)

Writing custom Linux schedulers is pretty easy using sched-ext. You can write your own tiny scheduler in a few lines of code using [C](https://mostlynerdless.de/blog/2024/10/25/a-minimal-scheduler-with-ebpf-sched_ext-and-c/), [Rust](https://github.com/sched-ext/scx), or even [Java](https://mostlynerdless.de/blog/2024/09/10/hello-ebpf-writing-a-linux-scheduler-in-java-with-ebpf-15/), see the [wiki](https://github.com/sched-ext/scx/wiki) for more. We're so confident in sched-ext that we're starting a Scheduler Contest for FOSDEM'25. Think you can craft the ultimate scheduler? A scheduler that does something interesting, helpful, or fun? Join our sched-ext contest and show us what you've got, with the chance of winning hand-crafted sched-ext swag!

## How to participate:
Submit your scheduler using sched-ext as a pull request to this repository, ensuring:

- It runs with a 6.12 Linux kernel.

- It's GPLv2-licensed

- It compiles and is understandable. We're programming language agnostic; just make sure to include a script so we can build and run it.

The [implementations.md](./submissions/implementations.md) document provides details on the submission format.

If you are planning to implement a scheduler in Rust, you can use this [template](https://github.com/arighi/scx_rust_scheduler) and follow these [steps](https://github.com/arighi/scx_rust_scheduler?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-up-a-virtual-environment-for-testing) to test it.

You can also submit a unique scheduling policy idea to [ideas.md](./submissions/ideas.md).

Try to surprise us...
